        <h2>Pre Reflection</h2>
        <div class="glass-card">
          <p>At the start of Semester 1, I considered my personal strengths to be solid analytical reasoning and technical proficiency in data science, but I recognised gaps in my communication, networking, and professional presentation skills. I felt confident solving mathematical problems and developing models, yet I was hesitant in networking situations, uncertain about how to introduce myself, and lacked a clear strategy for tailoring my resume or cover letter to specific roles. My goal was to become a more well-rounded candidate: equally proficient in conveying my technical expertise and in building relationships with industry professionals. To address these development areas, I engaged in a series of university-led professional workshops—starting with the English pronunciation and fluency session to improve clarity in speech, followed by resume and cover letter clinics to refine my application materials. I also participated in networking and strengths-identification workshops to practice introductions, articulate my unique attributes, and learn how to market them effectively. Each activity challenged me to step outside my comfort zone, provided structured guidance on best practices, and offered immediate feedback. By mid-semester, I noticed a shift: I felt more confident initiating conversations, my written materials gained polish, and I began to view professional development as an essential complement to my technical skill set.</p>

          <div class="star-model">
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> During early semester industry events, I felt my English pronunciation lacked clarity, hindering my ability to engage fully in networking sessions.</p>
            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Enhance clear pronunciation and speaking confidence specifically for professional contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Action:</strong> Attended the S1 English Pronunciation and Fluency Workshop (Activity 1), actively practiced targeted phonemes, participated in instructor-led drills, and applied feedback during breakout role-plays.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Achieved more precise articulation of challenging sounds, experienced smoother speech flow, and received positive remarks from friends and seniors on my improved clarity during a mock interview.</p>
            <p><strong>Lessons Learned / Plan:</strong> Realized the impact of focused, repetitive practice with expert guidance; I will continue weekly pronunciation exercises using Speech Active modules and seek peer feedback in future industry meetups.</p>
